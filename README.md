# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic to standardize how AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), interact with external tools, data sources, and systems. It provides a universal connector, enabling LLMs to dynamically access APIs, databases, and other resources, simplifying AI-to-tool communication and fostering greater modularity and interoperability.
